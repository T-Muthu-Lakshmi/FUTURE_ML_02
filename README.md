# 📈Task 2: CHURN PREDICTION SYSTEM

📌About the Task

• Develop a Churn Prediction System that identifies which customers are likely to stop using a service. This kind of model is crucial in industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking where retaining customers is more profitable than acquiring new ones.

🔍 What I worked on:
1) Explore and clean a customer dataset.
2) Engineer relevant features like contract type, payment method, or service usage.
3) Train and test classification models (Random Forest).
4) Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and churn probabilities.
5) Visualize key churn drivers and insights using Power BI or Matplotlib.

📊Random Forest Results

1) Accuracy: 79%
2) Precision: 78%
3) Recall: 79%
4) F1 Score: 78%
5) ROC-AUC: 0.8256

🛠️Tools

1) Python(Pandas, Matplotlib)
2) Scikit-learn
3) PowerBI
4) Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Features to Include

1) Feature importance chart
2) Confusion matrix and evaluation metrics
3) Dashboard summarizing business insights
